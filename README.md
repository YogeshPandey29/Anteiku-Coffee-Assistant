# Anteiku Coffee Assistant

## This is my second mini project related to Android Application Development. This objective of this application is to provide a simplified approach to accept and manage all coffee orders placed by the customers, in a hassle-free and efficient way. I started my attempt on this project while studying the basics of Android framework regarding the applications of layouts and implementation of Intents, Styles and Themes.

The application has an option for the customer to enter their name (which would appear in the final billing), followed by the list of all the toppings available at the moment for them to select.
After applying their choice of toppings, the number of units to be ordered must be entered.

Now, all the cutomer has to do is to just click the order button and finalize his call; upon which the order bill/data would be sent to the coffee shop. After the coffee shop receives the order they get an assurance
from the customer to start preparing their order.

## This mini project gave me a jump-start to further deep dive into the complicated yet fun concepts in Android framework.
